## San Francisco Crime Data Analysis and Modeling (Spark, Python, SQL)
- Performed spatial analysis over 1 million rows of data from SFPD for the past 15 years
- Designed ETL pipeline for big data OLAP based on Spark RDD, Dataframe and Spark SQL
- Utilized K-means to generate top 3 dangerous districts and visualized the variation of crimes over time to help travelers plan a safety route
- Analyzed detection rate of each crime category to help the police department in better allocating resources
